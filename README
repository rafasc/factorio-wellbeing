Monitor and alert system for time spent in game.

Technical Notes:

Alert intervals use "game minutes" and will be affected by anything that
changes game speed. Any mods or commands that changes the game speed and/or
game performance preventing the game running at 60ticks/s will produce
incorrect "in real-life" timings.

If you need precise real-world timing you'll have to resort to methods that
don't depend on the game engine. E.g. setting up an alarm in real life.

Due to technical limitations of the modding API, it is not trivial to
determine the session length of the player hosting a multiplayer server
or playing in single player mode.

Players in such categories should reset the timer manually by issuing:
    /wellbeing reset-timer
at the start of each session.

For the remaining players the timer is reset automatically when the
player joins the game.
